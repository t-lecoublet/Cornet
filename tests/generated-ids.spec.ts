// Every component that needs an id or a radio-group name derives it from
// `useComponentId`, never from `Math.random()`. Two properties matter and are
// checked here for all of them at once:
//
//   - uniqueness — two instances on the same page must not share a name, or
//     picking a row in one silently clears the other;
//   - determinism — the server and the client render independently, so a value
//     that differs between two identical renders is a hydration mismatch.
//
// Determinism is exercised by mounting into a fresh app each time, which is
// what resets Vue's id counter — the closest stand-in for a second render pass.
