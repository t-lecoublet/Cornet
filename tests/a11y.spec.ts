// axe-core over every exported component, in a configuration worth looking at.
//
// This is a floor, not a ceiling. Automated rules catch a minority of real
// accessibility problems — they see a missing accessible name, not a menu
// wearing the wrong role — so a clean run here does not mean a component is
// accessible. It means it has not regressed into the failures a machine can
// see. Keyboard behaviour and announced semantics are asserted in each
// component's own spec, and a screen-reader pass is still owed.
//
// The list comes from `index.ts` and the suite fails if a component is exported
// without a fixture: a sweep that quietly skips half the library is worse than
// no sweep, because it reads like coverage.
//
// The bar is `serious` and `critical`. `moderate`/`minor` findings are mostly
// contrast and landmark advice that depend on the page a consumer builds, not
// on the component.
